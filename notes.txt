next is friday -  26/05/23

(we are studying about how redirection through buttons,we already studied redirection througn links.)

Redirection In angular
----------------------

link - href/routerLink

method - navigateByUrl() - used to redirect to other pages
class  - Router
module - AppRoutingModule



package - folder - contain many no of files - collection of modules
module  - files  - collection of classes                    (one file can contain many classes,so many files can contan many classes. so module contains collection of classes)
class   - collection of methods

(in angular onclick will become click.)

Data Binding In Angular
------------------------

html - ts

view - component

1.one way data Binding

    1.1 - component to view
        1.1.1 - sting interpollation   {{}}
        1.1.2 - property binding [propertyName]='value'

    1.2 - view to component
        1.2.1 - event binding  (eventName)='methodName()'       -click
        1.2.2 - $event Binding (eventName)='methodName($event)' -change
        1.2.3 - event binding with template rendering variable  
                            (event)='method(templateRenderingVariable)'

2.two way data binding

    2.1- ngModel
            -FormsModule -module
(for doing two way data binding we have to first import the FormsModule)


life cycle blocks of Angular component
_______________________________________

constructor-->ngOnInit-->other methods


Dependency Injection
--------------------

used to access datas and methods of one class in another class(like inheritance)

- inside constructor()
- access specifier - private/public

[private(members cannot be accessed(or viewed)from outside the class)]
[public(members are accessible from outside the class)]


        constructor(private/public reference:ClassName)



profile view
balance check
money tranfer
account statement
delete account
logout


Angular Services
-----------------

a file used to keep datas and methods that can access by any components in that module

(-to create a service)
ng g s serviceName      (ng generate serv serviceName)


--------------------------------------------------------

after server we have reached angular again.

Api 
----

HttpClientModule - Module
HttpClient - class
methods
        get,put,post,patch,delete

(we have to give HttpClientModule in imports)
and we have to import it,no suggestion will be there,---import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http'



Asynchronous in ts
-------------------

js - promise - then()
             - catch()

ts - observable - subscribe()
                - catch()

Form Creation In angular
-------------------------

1.template driven form      (pure html) validation will be tough in this method
2.model driven form         (html and ts is used(a model will be created in ts file)) (in this there are many methods to easily do the validation of form)

so next we want to change the template driven form to model driven form.
so push this project to git
